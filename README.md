# Project-KB
We're developing an examination platform focused on the West Africa Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE), providing past questions and answers from 1993 to the present. The platform will primarily cover the four core subjects: English Language, Core Mathematics, Integrated Science, and Social Studies.
